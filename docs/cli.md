# Notary CLI

## Notary Server

The default notary server URL is [https://notary-server:4443/]. This default value can overridden (by priority order):

- by specifying the option `--server/-s` on commands requiring call to the notary server.
- by setting the `NOTARY_SERVER_URL` environment variable.
